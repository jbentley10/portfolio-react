                        While at LeapFrog, I worked in a team of 4 to develop a prototype math game for 4-7 year olds. I partictipated in daily stand ups, created a game design document, wireframed levels, and conducted user tests with kids.

                        him on a daily basis with creativity and enthusiasm. His work
